# NaturaVoyage --  A "Tourism Information System"

This project is a tourism-info-focused web application built with the MERN stack and Vite, where users can explore, add, and manage tourist spot information specific to a selected region.

## Key Features :

### 1. Region-Locked Tourist Data
  The site showcases tourist spots from a chosen category (e.g., Southeast Asia - Bangladesh), ensuring content remains region-specific 
  and relevant.
  
### 2. User Authentication and Protected Routes
  Login and registration are powered by Firebase authentication with support for Google/GitHub login. Protected routes such as Add Tourist 
  Spot, My List, and View Details require users to be logged in.
  
### 3. Complete CRUD Operations
  Users can create, read, update, and delete their own tourist spot entries. All operations include interactive feedback via toast or 
  sweet alert confirmations.
  
### 4. Dynamic and Responsive Interface
  Fully responsive across all devices. Includes sorting by average cost, filtering tourist spots by country, and additional UI 
  improvements like loading spinners and error pages.
  
### 5. Modern UI Enhancements
  Features a light/dark mode toggle and utilizes animation libraries like lottie-react, framer-motion, AOS package, React Leaflet, Swiper 
  slider and react-simple-typewriter to enrich the user experience.
